# 👋 Hi there, I'm Joshua Ruopp

I’m a Computer Science Bachelor graduate at Eberhard Karls University Tübingen with a strong interest in **Robotics**, **Applied AI**, and **algorithmic problem solving**.
I enjoy building systems that work end-to-end — from idea to running code.

## Interests & Focus

- **Robotics & Autonomous Systems**
  - Perception, control, motion planning
- **Large Language Models (LLMs) & NLP**
  - Practical usage of transformer-based models
  - Inference pipelines, prompt design, evaluation
- **Problem Solving & Software Engineering**
  - Clean code, data structures, robustness

## Projects

### 🎓 Bachelor Thesis
**Title:** Multi-modal Robot Manipulation combinging Gaze and Speech <br>
Integrating gaze tracking and speech recognition leveraging the Meta ARIA glasses with LLMs to control a robotic arm for diverse object manipulation tasks, especially sorting and selection Lego Duplo bricks.

Technologies:
- Language & Middleware: Python, ZeroMQ
- LLMs / NLP: HuggingFace Transformers
- Perception & Vision: YOLOv8, SuperGlue, FoundationPose
- Gaze Tracking: Meta ARIA SDK, SocialEye
